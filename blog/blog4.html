        This week, I wanted to get some more information on Meta Viewport. A good portion of this<br>
        came from a project in Highschool. My group made a computer game and in our code we used <br>
        a lot of fixed sizes (10 px, 100 px, etc.). This worked perfectly on the screens that we <br>
        developed on, but when I tried to play the game on my 4K laptop, the whole game was around <br>
        3 inches wide. The meta viewport tag is mainly used to make websites developed for computers <br>
        easily readable on mobile devices. By now, many mobile browsers support the meta tag. In the tag <br>
        that I used on this webpage, you can see that the width is set to device-width. This sets the width <br>
        to the width of the device that you're viewing the site from. This isn't dependent on how large <br>
        or small the screen is. The other portion is initial scale being set to 1. This just changes <br>
        the zoom of the page.<br><br>

        You can see the meta tag used for this page below:
        </p>

        <img src="images/blog4metatag.JPG" alt="metatag"><br>
        <p class = "text">
        <br>
        The link to this website was <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Viewport_meta_tag">here.</a>   
        </p>
        <br> 
        
        <p class = "text">
        I also learned that you can set the width field of the meta tag to a specific width in order to cater <br>
        to smaller screens. This width field, when given a specific number, acts as a minimum width. If this width <br>
        is set to 300, then 300px is the minimum width it can be. If the screen is larger than 300 pixels, the browser <br>
        chooses to expand the size of the viewport, as opposed to zooming in. There are other field that can be added <br>
        such as maximum and minimum scale and user-scalable. The article I read mentioned that its common for web <br>
        developers for mobile devices to set a maximum scale as too much zoom can have negatives effects on the page. <br><br>

        You can see some of these field in this example code:
