                    This week I wanted to start by getting some more information regarding flexbox, and specifically, different layouts for organizing a page.
                    I found an article that described different common layouts, and how to accomplish each of the layouts. One of the ones that caught my eye was
                    one which used flex-grow to create a middle box that was larger than the two surronding boxes. In the case of this blog post, I have the text
                    in the larger middle section and the pictures of the penguins surronding it. I could've justified the content to have space-between,
                    but since I was confused during class about flex-grow I wanted to incorporate it to make the middle section larger. <br> <br>
                    I first set the flex-grow to 1 for the middle section, then added a 2% margin and the left and right images. This method also required me to
                    fix the sizes of the two images, which I set a max-width. The article also explained that flex-grow would make it so that the text field in the
                    middle of the screen would take up all of the remaining space within the parent box (thats not being used by the pictures). Below the pictures
                    of the penguins, you can see the CSS code that I used to accomplish this. <br> <br>
                    The link to this website I used this week can be found <a href="https://tobiasahlin.com/blog/common-flexbox-patterns/">here.</a>
