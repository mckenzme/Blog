            I started my expedition to become an HTML master with some HTML tutorials to help fill in any gaps that I may have. Along the way I picked up the very useful
            information that I can create emojis using HTML code. You can create these emojis using "entity numbers" which are a sequence of numbers which represent a 
            UTF-8 character in this case. Example of these emojis include Stonehenge: &#128511; and the Statue of Liberty: &#128509; These entity numbers can be directly embeded into
            a paragraph like the example below.

            Another area that I did research on was Internal CSS. I always knew about CSS and that it let you format and style your HTML code. However, I didn't know that
            you could add CSS to your the head of your HTML file to change the style without the need for a seperate CSS file. All you need to add is a style section to head in order
            to change the style. Below is an example where I changed the color of this paragraph to blue and the font size to 200% of the normal size all within the head section.
