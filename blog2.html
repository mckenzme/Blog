        <p>
        This week I first encountered trouble figuring out how to link my CSS and HTML files<br>
        together. My partner actually did this step without me knowing so I spent a while trying <br>
        to get my CSS file to affect my webpage. The article that I ended up reading was similar <br>
        to one of the articles I read last week, but while last week I read how to write <br>
        CSS inside an HTML file, this week I learned about how to link an external file. <br>
        All I ended up needing to do was include this line in my header section:<br>
        </p>
        <br>

        The link to this website was <a href="http://www.corelangs.com/css/basics/linking.html">here.</a>   
        </p>
        <br> <br>
        <div class = p1>
            <p>
            I also wanted to get some more clarification on when to use the id tag and <br>
            when to create a whole new class for CSS code. I learned that ids are mainly used when <br>
            defining a </p> <p id="singleelement">single element</p> <p> or object in your HTML code. Classes had a much broader <br>
            use, as they could be used on a single or multiple different HTML elements. For example <br>
            in this section, I used a class to define this "paragraph" as a whole to be a class. <br>
            As a class, I made this section have white font, black background, and to be in the font <br>
            Helvetica. On the individual "id" level, I just made the the text "single element" purple<br>
            The code for doing this:<br>
            </p>
        </div>
