        I think that everyone has already mentioned how the pacing of this class was pretty intensive. The first portion <br>
        of the class where we learned HTML and CSS went very well. The material and book were easy to read and digest and <br>
        it was cool creating visual elements as a result of our code. The FlexBox stuff was where the class started getting <br>
        a little complicated, but it was still manageable with practice outside of class. However, this class quickly went from <br>
        learning how to make everything visually pleasing to coding in JavaScript. I think that portion of the class has to be <br>
        it's own class honestly. It just felt really rushed and I felt like I was just copying the examples from the book rather<br>
        than learning how to code original JavaScript. If the book didn't have any of the examples and didn't literally walk us<br>
        through every step, I don't think we would have been able to complete the projects. <br><br>

        I think there could be one whole class dedicated to HTML and CSS (and maybe a little JavaScript towards the end of the year). <br>
        This would allow everyone to focus entirely on the JavaScript side of things. I'm also not sure how well the reverse learning <br>
        model of the class would line up with the JavaScipt section of Web Dev. I think the concepts are pretty complicated and people <br>
        might need more than time at home / one class period for a whole lab. I also thought that after the purely HTML and CSS labs, <br>
        we didn't actually know enough JavaScript to finish a lab in the period. Maybe it would be more beneficial to have multiple <br>
        days per lab. Lastly, I really liked the projects in this class. They were when I actually felt like I was getting a solid <br>
        footing for the material. I especially liked seeing the relationship between Project 2 and 3. It was cool that we were able to <br>
        use a project that we made in the past and directly use it for the 3rd project. I think it would be smart to at least keep these <br>
        two projects in that order.
